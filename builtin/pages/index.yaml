        ## Philosophy

        The Coralbits Page Editor follows a **microservices-first** approach, where each component is treated as an independent service.
        This design philosophy enables:

        - **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently
        - **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
        - **Flexibility**: Easy to add, remove, or modify components
        - **Reusability**: Components can be shared across different projects

        Whether you're building a simple landing page or a complex web application, the Coralbits Page Editor provides the tools and flexibility you need.
