        The Coralbits Page Editor is a powerful, API-first page editor and renderer designed for modern web development. 
        It provides a flexible, component-based approach to creating dynamic web pages with an embedded Single Page Application (SPA) interface.

        ## Key Features

        - **Component-Based Architecture**: Built-in and extensible components
        - **API-First Design**: RESTful API for page generation and editing
        - **Embedded SPA Editor**: Rich editing experience within your applications
        - **Flexible Rendering**: Generate HTML from built-in elements or external microservices
        - **Caching Support**: Intelligent caching for optimal performance
        - **Extensible**: Easy integration with external components via REST APIs

        ## Philosophy

        The Coralbits Page Editor follows a **microservices-first** approach, where each component is treated as an independent service. 
        This design philosophy enables:

        - **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently
        - **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
        - **Flexibility**: Easy to add, remove, or modify components
        - **Reusability**: Components can be shared across different projects

        Whether you're building a simple landing page or a complex web application, the Coralbits Page Editor provides the tools and flexibility you need.
